## Customizing Your Program

Edit `program.json` to customize your workout program:

```json
{
  "name": "Your Program Name",
  "description": "Program description",
  "cycle_weeks": 4,
  "splits": {
    "A": {
      "name": "Upper Body",
      "exercises": [
        {
          "name": "Bench Press",
          "sets": [4, 4, 4, 3],
          "reps": [8, 6, 4, 8]
        }
      ]
    },
    "B": {
      "name": "Lower Body",
      "exercises": [...]
    }
  }
}
```

- `cycle_weeks`: Number of weeks in your periodization cycle
- `sets`: Array of sets per week (length should match cycle_weeks)
- `reps`: Array of target reps per week
- The program automatically alternates between A and B splits weekly

## Configuration

Edit `.env` to configure:

- `SECRET_KEY`: Flask secret key (required for production)
- `DATABASE_URL`: SQLite database path (default: `sqlite:///workout_tracker.db`)
- `PROGRAM_JSON_PATH`: Path to your program JSON file
- `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`: Set to `true` in production with HTTPS

## Development

The application uses:
- **Flask**: Web framework
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database operations
- **SQLite**: Default database (easy to change to PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- **Werkzeug**: Password hashing and security utilities

## Security Notes

- Passwords are securely hashed using Werkzeug's password hashing (PBKDF2)
- Sessions are secure with HttpOnly cookies
- User sessions persist for 3 days when "Remember me" is checked
- Each user's data is isolated via user_id
- Coach view tokens are unique per user and can be regenerated
